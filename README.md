Lucky you: you've made it to a shelter just before the bombs dropped. Even better, you've found a working radio. Listen for clues and call for rescue!

This is my entry into the [Doomsday Game Jam 2023](https://itch.io/jam/doomsday-game-jam). As with all game jams, it's not very finished! I am very pleased with the visuals and the concept. I would have liked to get in more content / puzzle game play, plus juice up the buttons and audio.
